## Document Vault with Time-Based Messaging MVP

This MVP implements a simple document vault with a time-based messaging system. Key features include:

1. Document storage and retrieval
2. Countdown timer with reset functionality
3. Automatic message sending when the countdown expires
4. Simple web interface for receiving "I'm alive" signals and adding documents

### Implementation Details

- The core functionality is implemented in the `DocumentVault` class.
- Flask is used to create a simple web server for handling API requests.
- Documents are stored in memory (for MVP purposes) using a dictionary.
- The countdown timer is implemented using datetime comparisons.
- Email sending is handled using the `smtplib` library.
- A separate loop checks the countdown status every minute.

### Next Steps

1. Implement persistent storage for documents (e.g., database integration)
2. Add user authentication and authorization
3. Improve error handling and logging
4. Implement more robust scheduling for the countdown check (e.g., using Celery)
5. Add a user interface for document management and system configuration
6. Enhance security measures (e.g., encryption for stored documents)
7. Implement unit and integration tests

### Challenges and Considerations

- Ensuring the reliability of the "I'm alive" signal mechanism
- Handling potential network issues when sending emails
- Scaling the solution for larger numbers of documents and users
- Ensuring data privacy and security compliance (GDPR, etc.)
