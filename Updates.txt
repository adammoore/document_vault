## Document Vault with Time-Based Messaging MVP

This MVP implements a simple document vault with a time-based messaging system. Key features include:

1. Document storage and retrieval
2. Countdown timer with reset functionality
3. Automatic message sending when the countdown expires
4. Simple web interface for receiving "I'm alive" signals and adding documents

### Implementation Details

- The core functionality is implemented in the `DocumentVault` class.
- Flask is used to create a simple web server for handling API requests.
- Documents are stored in memory (for MVP purposes) using a dictionary.
- The countdown timer is implemented using datetime comparisons.
- Email sending is handled using the `smtplib` library.
- A separate loop checks the countdown status every minute.

### Next Steps

1. Implement persistent storage for documents (e.g., database integration)
2. Add user authentication and authorization
3. Improve error handling and logging
4. Implement more robust scheduling for the countdown check (e.g., using Celery)
5. Add a user interface for document management and system configuration
6. Enhance security measures (e.g., encryption for stored documents)
7. Implement unit and integration tests

### Challenges and Considerations

- Ensuring the reliability of the "I'm alive" signal mechanism
- Handling potential network issues when sending emails
- Scaling the solution for larger numbers of documents and users
- Ensuring data privacy and security compliance (GDPR, etc.)


## Document Vault with Time-Based Messaging MVP - Update 1

### New Features and Changes
1. Implemented email link functionality for resetting the countdown timer
2. Created a setup script for initializing the project structure
3. Added instructions for setting up the GitHub project

### Implementation Details
- Modified the `DocumentVault` class to include a reset token
- Added a new Flask route `/reset/<token>` to handle timer resets via email link
- Updated the `send_message` method to include the reset link in the email
- Created a shell script `setup_project.sh` to set up the project structure

### Next Steps
1. Implement persistent storage for documents (e.g., database integration)
2. Add user authentication and authorization
3. Improve error handling and logging
4. Implement more robust scheduling for the countdown check (e.g., using Celery)
5. Add a user interface for document management and system configuration
6. Enhance security measures (e.g., encryption for stored documents)
7. Implement unit and integration tests
8. Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline

### Challenges and Considerations
- Ensuring the security of the reset link in emails
- Handling potential abuse of the reset link
- Implementing proper error handling for email sending failures
